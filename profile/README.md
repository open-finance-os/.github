## What is this?

OpenFinance-OS is a **community-driven initiative** to bring visibility, resources, and collaboration to the UAE Open Finance ecosystem.

We are **not** an official regulator, scheme operator, or financial institution. We are developers, fintechs, bankers, and enthusiasts who believe open ecosystems thrive on transparency.

**We link to official sources. We don't replace them.**
